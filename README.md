# NCAA-Team-Wins

**Intro** - Every year at the end of April through March comes one of the biggest college events of the year called March Madness. In the tournament 64 teams compete on national television in a single elemination style. This project looked at the number of wins and statistics for each team from 2015-2019 as the report was made in 2020 and didn't want to use a partial season. The goal was to predict the number of wins of a team to help us determine what teams are more likely to win.

**Tools** - Python, R, Excel

**Data** - Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/andrewsundberg/college-basketball-dataset

**Methods/Evaluation/Techniques** - Distributions, Visualizations, Modeling

**Conclusion** - In conclusion, it is quite difficult to predict the exact number of games. The models accuracies were around 30% to predict the exact number of games, but if we start to  look at the number of wins within a game or two then the accuracy quick increases as seen in the screenshot above.
